To go to the web server in Postman or your web browser type: http://127.0.0.1:5000/get_chain or http://127.0.0.1:5000/mine_block.
The style of the blocks or presented data will be in a json format I have not done any frontend code for this.
This was made using IDLE Python 3.9 with Flask, jsonify, json, hashlib, and datetime.
This also uses the sha-256 encryption for the blocks.
